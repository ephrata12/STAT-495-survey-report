# STAT-495-Survey-Report

Project Data Acumen was conducted in the fall of 2024 as part of STAT 495 to assess the Statistics proficiency of students in the class. The project seeks to evaluate students’ experience and confidence across 58 distinct measures of data acumen, spanning critical areas such as mathematical skills, statistical knowledge, computational expertise, and data visualization techniques, among other key dimensions of data competency. 

The collected data was then wrangled and subjected to various analyses to identify trends and patterns in students’ reporting. The project aims to answer three central questions: 

1) **Cohen’s Kappa Correlation**: What is the correlation between students’ agreement on various topics related to data acumen?
2) **Experience and Confidence Gaps**: Which areas of data acumen do students feel least confident in, and where are the largest gaps in expertise?
3) **Common Goals and Interests**: What are the most common goals and areas of interest among STAT 495 students in relation to data proficiency?
