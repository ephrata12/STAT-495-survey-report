# STAT 495: Exploring Data Acumen in Advanced Statistics Students

## Project Overview
This project analyzes self-reported confidence and experience in data acumen among STAT 495 students. By examining responses across 58 distinct measures, it identifies patterns, gaps, and areas for improvement in students' statistical proficiency. The findings aim to inform curriculum development and foster a balanced learning environment.

## Key Research Questions
1. **Alignment in Confidence Across Topics**: How do students’ self-reported confidence levels align across topics, and what patterns of agreement or disagreement emerge?
2. **Experience vs. Confidence Gaps**: Where do gaps exist between students’ experience and confidence, and which variables show the largest discrepancies?
3. **Goals and Interests**: What are the most common goals and interests among STAT 495 students?

## Dataset
